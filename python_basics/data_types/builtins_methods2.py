# Below you can see a student_grades list. 
# Your task is to use Python to count how many items with a value of 10.0 are in the student_grades list. 
# Once you find the proper list method that counts items, then print out its output using a print() function.

student_grades = [9.1, 8.8, 10.0, 7.7, 6.8, 8.0, 10.0, 8.1, 10.0, 9.9, 10.0]
print(student_grades.count(10.0))
