# **More String Formatting**
There is also another way to format strings using the *"{}".format(variable)* form. Here is an example:
```
name = "John"
surname = "Smith"
 
message = "Your name is {}. Your surname is {}".format(name, surname)
print(message)
```
Output: *Your name is John. Your surname is Smith*
