Hi,<br>
I run the following code and expected to get the division in the last print but i got an error.

3. **Here is my code:**
```py
a = 1
b = "2"
c = 3
print(int(2.5))
print(c/0)
```
4. **And here is the error:**

2<br>
Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
  File "difficult_errors.py", line 3, in 'module'<br>
    print(c/0)<br>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Can you help?
