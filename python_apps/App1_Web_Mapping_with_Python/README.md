# **Welcome to the First App**

## **App 1:Web Mapping with Python: Interactive Mapping of Population and Volcanoes**

Congratulations on reaching the applications part! The following videos will guide you on how to build a program that generates interactive web maps with Python. The program combines the core Python building blocks such as conditionals, for-loops, functions, and file processing with the extras of a third-party Python library used to generate beautiful web maps.

This will help you practice the Python core concepts, and you will also learn how to approach and use third-party Python libraries. Every other real-world program you will build during your Python career will also combine the Python building blocks with specialized third-party libraries, so this app introduces you into the world of making real-world programs with Python.

To make the most of the videos, try to play around with the code that you see in the videos. Try to experiment with the code, change it, add more functionalities if you can, and see how the output changes. You will succeed if you do that.
